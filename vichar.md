## Sewa - The two different meanings

Sewa could be defined as a service to the underprivileged, performed without any hopes of reciprocation. 
Why is the term “underprivileged” used here? The reason being - if the service recipient is influential 
or affluent, there is an expectation that the service could be reciprocated. The term “underprivileged” 
in this context doesn’t mean only wealth. It could be any type of privileges such as power, influence, 
strength, education, profile in the society or profession, family etc. The requirement is that a person 
providing the service (Sewa), should not envision that the recipient will be able to reciprocate it in 
any form in the present or in the future. That is why Sewa could be termed in a single word as a Selfless act or service.

 

There is another meaning attributed to Sewa, which is - Altruism. The Cambridge dictionary defines Altruism as a “willingness to do things that brings advantages to others, even if it results in disadvantage of yourself”. Rig Veda defines Altruism as: “He alone lives who lives for the sake of helping others''. This thought is exemplified in the story of King Ranti Deva contained in Bhagavata written by Sage Veda Vyasa. During his reign, his kingdom was gripped once by severe and devastating famine and his subjects were hungry and distressed. Moved by their suffering, the King determined that he would share in their misery and decided to fast himself until all the hungry were fed. His fast lasted for forty-eight days, during which period he took no food and not even water but served his poor subjects. 


At the end of forty-eight days of fasting, he wanted to break his fast by taking a morsel of food and a glass of water. His ministers and councilors were with him at the time of breaking his fast. Just when he was about to drink a glass of water, he heard the pitiful cry of Pulkasa asking for water to drink desperately. The King immediately ordered that his glass of water be passed on to Pulkasa in spite of the remonstrations of his ministers and his own condition. He then proceeded to eat a morsel of food. Just at that time, a guest came at his door, asking for food. The King gave the morsel to the guest. The people around him pleaded with him not to do so since his life itself was in danger. The reply that the King gave at that time stands out as the altitude of true Altruism. He said, “I do not seek from God the Highest bliss attended with eight types of powers (siddhis). Nor do I care for my salvation or freedom from the cycle of births and deaths. My only desire is to be present in all beings (share their feelings) and undergo suffering with them and serve them so that they may become free from misery, hunger, thirst, fatigue, loss of strength in limbs, distress, grief disappointment, delusion - all these undesirable features of my distressed - soul have all disappeared upon my giving water to one who was suffering from acute thirst”.


Sewa in both the meanings - A Selfless act or Altruism are humanitarian endeavors praised by all religions or culture. The Hinduism context goes further - as nicely presented by King Ranti Deva quote in the previous paragraph that could be summarized as - the Sewa’s objective is to help free the recipient from the misery, and the Sewa provider doesn’t expect reciprocity, not in this world or any other world.
