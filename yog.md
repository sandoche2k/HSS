Ardha means half. Chakra means wheel. In this posture, as the body takes the shape of a half wheel, hence it is called Ardha Cakrāsasna.

### Technique:

* Stand straight with feet 2 inches apart. Support the back at the sides of the waist with the fingers. Try to keep the elbows parallel. Drop the head backwards stretching the neck muscles.
* As you inhale, bend backwards from the lumbar region; exhale and relax. Stay here for 10-30 seconds with normal breathing. Inhale and slowly come up.
